when push the codes, it comes warning: could not find UI helper 'GitHub.UI'

the resolution i get from: https://code2care.org/git/warning-could-not-find-ui-helper-github-ui-on-windows
the issue seems to be with Git Credential Manager v 2.39.0 which is installing along with the git install.

Workaround Fix:
Until a new release is available, below are some workarounds.

  Reinstall Git without selecting 'none' on the screen where have the option to "choose a Credential Manager"(not test)
  Rollback to Git version 2.38.x (older releases https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/releases/)(not working, or my setting is wrong)
  Use GitHub Desktop application.(convenient method)
